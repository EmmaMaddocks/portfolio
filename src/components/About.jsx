<h1>About</h1>
<p>I began my coding journey later in life, after running a successful laser cutting and UV printing studio for several years. Much of my learning was through an full-stack software development bootcamp with Northcoders, however I enjoy taking extra courses in my spare time in interactivity, animation and UX design.
  With my background in design, I am passionate about solving problems in a creative, user friendly and memorable way. When I'm not building websites, you can probably find me paddleboarding, hiking or playing with my three young children.</p>
