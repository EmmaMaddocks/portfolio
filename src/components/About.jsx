<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>My name is Emma and I am passionate about building creative, user friendly and memorable things for the internet</p>
<p>Whilst my love for design began as a teenager where I would design 'Bebo' themes on photoshop for my friends, I began my coding journey later in life.</p>
    
<p>After running a successful laser cutting and UV printing studio for several years around my three children, I decided I wanted a change. I began building websites for small businesses and found I loved combining my passion for design with coding and began taking on online course in full stack development in my spare time. Hooked on coding, I decided to put all my effort in to learning to code, and joined a full time bootcamp with Northcoders.</p>

<p>Having finished the bootcamp in November 2022, I'm now looking to kick start my new career and find my first position as a junior developer.</p>
